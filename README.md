SGS2SetVolumeTest
=================

This is a minimal Android application built to test MediaPlayer.setVolume().  On my phone, setVolume doesn't do anything if the file being played is a long mp3. Ogg vorbis files and short mp3s are not affected.

The app includes a short tone (30 seconds) and a long tone (6 minutes). Use the buttons to start playing either file, and then press the pan buttons to try to pan the audio left and right. If your phone shares the same bug, the pan buttons will work for the short file but not the long file.

To install the app, download the APK from the [binaries branch](https://github.com/divergentdave/SGS2SetVolumeTest/blob/binaries/SGS2SetVolumeTest.apk?raw=true) or scan this QR code with your phone.
